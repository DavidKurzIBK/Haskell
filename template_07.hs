{-
What do div1 and div2 do? Give an example that shows the difference between div1 and div2.

1. fractional a = type constraint for this subclass of number-type-class. type a must be instance of fractional type class.  
2. Fractional: provides operations for division and operations of fractions. Instances of Fractional include Float, Double, but not Rational.
3. most general type for div1 and div2 is function takes value of type a and returns value of the same type a.
4. a = 8: div(8/2) = 4
5. a = 8: div(2/8) = 0.25

-- Question 1.2
{-
What do div3 and div4 do?  Give an example that shows the difference between div3 and div4.
(.) is composition operator. type is (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c, takes two functions as arguments and returns a new function that composes them.
if a = 8: 
div3 performes div(smth is happening but (8/2) has priority) ?? 
div4 performes div ((smth happening to 8)/2) ??

-- Question 1.3
{-
Which of the following pairs of functions are equal? Justify your answers.

(i) div3 and div5: 
div3 and div5 are not equal. 
div3 takes a function of type (a -> a) and returns another function of the same type, 
div5 takes a function of type (a -> b) and returns a function of the same type. 
Types of functions they operate on are different, so they are not equal.


(ii) div5 and flip div6: 
div5 and flip div6 are not equal. 
div5 takes a function and composes with div1, which is function of type (Fractional a => a -> a). 
flip div6 takes two arguments and applies them in reverse order. 
Types and behaviors of these functions are different. 


(iii) div7 and div8: 
div7 and div8 are not equal. 
div7 takes a tuple with a function of type (a -> a) -> (a -> a) and a value of type a and applies div3 to them,
div8 takes a tuple with a function of type (a -> a) and value of type a and applies different operation (f (x / 2)). 
Types and behaviors of these functions are different.
